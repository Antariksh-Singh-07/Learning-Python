Youthful hearts innocent and free     
Sunlit days under love's tree        
Smiles bloom laughter's sweet song    
In their eyes a connection strong    

Hand in hand exploring life's maze    
Whispered words setting hearts ablaze
Blushing cheeks feelings untold       
Two young souls love takes hold      

Adventures shared dreams take flight
Stars above guiding each night
Growth and love intertwined fate
Their story begins hearts resonate

Moonlit strolls hand in hand
Writing their names in the sand
Promises whispered on gentle breeze
Eternal love as time does freeze

Shared glances unspoken desire
Burning like a passionate fire
Through challenges faced their bond remains
Love's endurance forever sustains

Years unfold their love matures
Deeper than the ocean's allure
Hand in hand they face life's quest
Together always they are blessed

A journey of love beautifully spun
Two hearts united two souls as one
From youth to old age a love story told
A love that grows never grows old
